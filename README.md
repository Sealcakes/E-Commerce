# E-Commerce

## Description
This project was very helpful in working on the routing fundamentals of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.  The project sets up an E-Commerce backend so that you can create categories, products and tags for items to sell in an E-commerce store.

## Installation
1. You will need to run the following code when you first open the project to install all the dependencies.

2. You will then need to source the database by logging in to your MySQL account and then running the following code.
    `source db/schema.sql;`
3. Quit your MySQL and then seed the database.
    `node seeds/index.js`
4. Start the server
    `npm start`
